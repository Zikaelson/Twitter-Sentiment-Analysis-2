# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-2

### Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.

Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.


### Objective of this Analysis

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.

Note: The evaluation metric from this practice problem is F1-Score.
